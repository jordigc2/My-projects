  - Some of the non-confidetial projects done along my Career as a programmer. 
  - [Curriculum Vitae](https://github.com/jordigc2/My-projects/blob/master/Jordi%20Gonzalez%20Cano%20CV.pdf).
  
### Education
- **\[Sep 2018 – Aug 2020]** I have studied a master in Autonomous Systems at Aalborg University of Copenhagen (AAU) and at Technical University of Denmark (DTU).
- **\[Sep 2016 – Feb 2017]** Erasmus+ at University of Twente.
- **\[Sep 2014 – Jul 2018]** I have studied a bachelor in Computer Science at Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona (UAB)

### Profetional experiance
- **\[Aug 2020 – Present]** Currently working at Mobile Industrial Robots A/S (MiR), where I work with Computer Vision, Machine Learning algorithms and together with the NVIDIA JetPack on a Jetson board.
- **\[Feb 2020 – Aug 2020]** Master thesis at Mobile Industrial Robots A/S (MiR), where I developed my master thesis about Visual SLAM with multiple cameras build on a MiR robot in C++.
- **\[Sep 2019 – Jan 2020]** Internship at Mobile Industrial Robots A/S (MiR), where I worked in Multiple Object tracking algorithm using OpenCV, YOLO_v3 tinny and the Deepstream SDK.
- **\[Mar 2019 – Aug 2019]** Student Assitant at Copenhagen Buisness School (CBS), where I worked in Educational Nudging, Statistics and Machine Learning by analysing the performance and the effort along their studies.
- **\[Feb 2018 – Jul 2018]** Intership at HP Inc, where I developed my bachelor thesis.


### Projects
- **\[Sep 2018 - Jan 2019]** [**Development of an AGV**](https://github.com/jordigc2/AGV_Project). This project it has been developed along the first semester of the master in Autonomous Systems at Aalborg University. It consists on developing an AGV in a simplified warehouse, where it has to collect the components needed in order to assemble the desired products. To develop this project it has been used ROS, Python, PID controller, VICON and optimization algorithms(graph theory). In this folder is stored the whole project, including the final report and a demo.
- **\[Feb 2018 – Jul 2018]** [**Bachelor thesis**](https://github.com/jordigc2/My-projects/tree/master/Bachelor%20thesis). This project has been developed in HP Inc and the goal is to compute the Color Management with Machine Learning techniques. In this folder it is stored the final report and a poster that summarize the project. 
- **\[Dec 2016 - Feb 2017]** [**Smart Cities project**](https://github.com/jordigc2/My-projects/tree/master/Smart%20Cities). Project developed in C++ using threads to control each object of the simulation. The project consisted on explore a pipeline with a swarm of robots instead of digging the ground and using humans to explore the pipelines. In this folder is stored a poster and a video accelerated *x16* of the simulation.
- **\[Sep 2016 - Dec 2016]** [**Serious Gaming project**](https://github.com/jordigc2/My-projects/tree/master/Serious%20Gaming). Project developed in C# using the Unity platform. A serious game consist on change a person way of thinking about a topic, in this case the game is about pollution. In this folder there is a .zip where is stored an Android version and a Windows version of the game.
