- In this repository I expose:
  - Some of the projects done along my Career as a programmer. 
  - [Curriculum Vitae](https://github.com/jordigc2/My-projects/blob/master/Jordi%20Gonzalez%20Cano%20CV.pdf).
  
### Background
- From September 2016 till February 2017, Erasmus at University of Twente.
- In July 2018, obtained the bachelor on computer science at Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, speciallized on computation. 
- Intership in HP Inc for 6 months, where I developed my bachelor thesis.

- Since September 2018, studying a master in Autonomous Systems at Aalborg University of Copenhagen.

### Projects
- **\[Sep 2016 - Dec 2016]** [**Serious Gaming project**](https://github.com/jordigc2/My-projects/tree/master/Serious%20Gaming). Project developed in C# using the Unity platform. A serious game consist on change a person way of thinking about a topic, in this case the game is about pollution. In this folder there is a .zip where is stored an Android version and a Windows version of the game.
- **\[Dec 2016 - Feb 2017]** [**Smart Cities project**](https://github.com/jordigc2/My-projects/tree/master/Smart%20Cities). Project developed in C++ using threads to control each object of the simulation. The project consisted on explore a pipeline with a swarm of robots instead of digging the ground and using humans to explore the pipelines. In this folder is stored a poster and a video accelerated *x16* of the simulation.
- **\[Feb 2018 â€“ Jul 2018]** [**Bachelor thesis**](https://github.com/jordigc2/My-projects/tree/master/Bachelor%20thesis). This project has been developed in HP Inc and the goal is to compute the Color Management with Machine Learning techniques. In this folder it is stored the final report and a poster that summarize the project. 
- **\[Sep 2018 - Jan 2019]** [**Development of an AGV**](https://github.com/jordigc2/AGV_Project). This project it has been developed along the first semester of the master in Autonomous Systems at Aalborg University. It consists on developing an AGV in a simplified warehouse, where it has to collect the components needed in order to assemble the desired products. To develop this project it has been used ROS, Python, PID controller, VICON and optimization algorithms(graph theory). In this folder is stored the whole project, including the final report and a demo.
